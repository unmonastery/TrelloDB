In 1987, the Singapore government, after having acquired the land on both islands from the islanders, set about relocating the islanders to the mainland where they were resettled in the Bukit Merah and Telok Blangah housing estate areas by HDB. One of the oldest residents continued to live on the Pulau Sakeng despite his family having been resettled but he eventually moved out as well in 1991, as the island's jetty fell into a sorry state of disrepair. After which, the Singapore SPCA was tasked to round up the few cats that were left behind after his departure. Subsequently, Pulau Sakeng was subsumed by the land reclamation process of Pulau Semakau and the present day. Semakau landfill receiving station was built directly on top of Pulau Sakeng after that process.",
